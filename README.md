Wine Classification Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of wine types using the Wine dataset from sklearn.datasets. It involves preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation to accurately classify wines into distinct types based on their chemical characteristics.

Features of the Project
* Dataset: Uses the Wine dataset, which requires preprocessing due to varied scales of features.
* Data Visualization: Includes plots of raw and scaled data for initial two features (Alcohol Content and Malic Acid Content) for a visual understanding of the dataset.
* Preprocessing: Implements MinMaxScaler for normalization, ensuring all features contribute equally to the model.
* Model Selection: Utilizes three classification algorithms – Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Employs GridSearchCV for systematic hyperparameter optimization.
* Cross-Validation: Uses Stratified K-Fold cross-validation for a more robust model evaluation.
* Performance Metrics: Measures and compares model accuracy and computational efficiency.
* Result Visualization: Presents results using boxplots to compare accuracies and computation times across models.
* Code Clarity: Code is well-commented for easy understanding, and variable names are descriptive.
